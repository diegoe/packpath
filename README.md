# packpath
Automatically upload Signal stickers from a given path and YAML configuration


## Install it

The package is available in PyPI, through `pip`:
```sh
  $ pip3 install packpath
```

But you can also simply checkout this repository and run it as a module:
```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/diegoe/packpath.git
  $ cd packpath
  $ python3 -m packpath (plus arguments, see below)
```

## How it works

`packpath` reads a path and loads a `config.yaml` file from it to automatically
fill a `signalstickers-client` client, and submit stickers.

It subclasses `signalstickers_client.models.LocalStickerPack` to add a
`load_path()` method.

You need to provide your username and password, as well as the path to a
sticker directory containing a `config.yaml` file. See below for details
on both, or run `packpath --help`:

```sh
  $ packpath --user [uuid_id] --password [password] [path_to_sticker_dir]

  # Most of this README and its instructions are available in the
  # command's help:
  $ packpath --help
```


## YAML format

The YAML format is rather simple:

```yaml
pack:
  title: Your sticker pack title
  author: An author name
  cover: filename-for-the-cover.png

stickers:
  filename.png: ðŸ‘€
  another-filename.png: ðŸ‘‹
  (...)
```

To save yourself some work, you can use `ls` to output an almost ready
list of filenames to use on your `config.yaml`:

```sh
  $ ls -1 >> config.yaml
```


## Signal credentials

From https://github.com/signalstickers/signalstickers-client#uploading-a-pack:

> You will need your Signal credentials To obtain them, open the
> Developer Tools in Signal Desktop, and type
> window.reduxStore.getState().items.uuid_id to get your USER, and
> window.reduxStore.getState().items.password to get your PASSWORD.

The above is also available in `python3 -m packpath --help`.
